📊 Automobile Sales Analysis & Interactive Dashboard

A data-driven exploration of how economic factors influence automobile sales.

This project provides a complete analytical workflow exploring historical automobile sales and their relationship with key economic indicators. Through detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and an interactive Plotly Dash dashboard, the project uncovers insights about recession impacts, consumer confidence, unemployment rate trends, and vehicle type performance.

Both static visualizations (Matplotlib/Seaborn) and dynamic dashboards (Dash) are used to deliver a comprehensive analytical experience.
